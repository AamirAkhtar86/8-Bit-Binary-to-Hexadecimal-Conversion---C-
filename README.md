"GetHexFromBin.h" is a custom created header file which is created to take 32 bit (4 bytes) as input and out hexadecimal value (4 bytes) as output.

"test.cpp" file has been added to test the header file.

To include a custom header we use "" which means header file is present in the current directory and <> mean that header file is present in c++ default 
library path.
